Name of Student: **Matthew Eilar**

Name of Project: **Goodreads Clone (needs a better name)**

Project's Purpose or Goal: 

**Goodreads is a popular book reading tracking app. It was bought by Amazon in 2013 and development on it basically stopped. The time is right for a modern app to keep track of book lists, logging books read, etc.**

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

**- App must compile and run on iOS.** 
**- App must hold a database of books.** 
**- User must be able to add, edit, and delete books from their account database.**

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

**I plan to develop this iOS application in the latest version of Swift, developing on Apple Xcode IDE. In order to reach MVP, I will need to learn how to build an iOS app in Xcode, build UI views with SwiftUI, and store user data in iCloud with Cloud Kit.**

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.


**If MVP is reached, I can think of many different directions to go. These include:**

* **Incorporating search and automatic book metadating import through Open Library API.**
* **Bulk importing of Goodreads exports or .csv**
* **Visualization of reading data ala Spotify Wrapped**
* **Distributing a beta version of the app through the App Store by enrolling in Developer Program**
* **User accounts and authentication to open up options to develop for other platforms**

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

**All of these additional features can be built in Swift with Apple APIs.**

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

**My plan is to start by working through a couple of app development tutorials to get a feel for Swift and Swift UI, if it seems like this is too difficult then I will explore pivoting to building the same project in React Native.**
